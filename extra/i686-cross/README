C cross compiler config targetting i686-linux-gnu. Used for building D
toolchains which _run_ on i686 (host == i686)

There are some issues which require manually editing the .la
files in the compilers sysroot/lib directory. The path to the library
is hardcoded in the last line, if the toolchain is moved from /home/build/install
to home/build/crosscc that needs to be adjusted. To build gdb with this
compiler we also need i686 ncurses libraries as crosstool doesn't build
these for us. Procompiled ncurses libraries are in ~/crosscc/i686-linux-libs
and should be copied into the sysroot of the built toolchain.
